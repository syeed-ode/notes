		While in MongoDB, there is no concept of relationship.
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel






The following is from https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/

==> Caveats
==> mongodb-community
To have launchd start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community now and restart at login:
  brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf

20210706_15:34:54 junk syeedode$ 

You can run MongoDB as a macOS service using brew, or you can run MongoDB manually as a background process. 
It is recommended to run MongoDB as a macOS service, as doing so sets the correct system ulimit values automatically (see ulimit settings for more information).




To run MongoDB (i.e. the mongod process) as a macOS service, issue the following:

$ brew services start mongodb-community@4.4

To verify that MongoDB is running, perform one of the following:

$ brew services list
20210706_15:45:37 junk syeedode$ brew services list
			Name              Status  User     Plist

Data Model Design - Embedded Data Model / Normalized Data Model
		Embedded Data Model - 
				you can have (embed) all the related data in a single document. Assume we are getting the details of employees in three different documents namely, Personal_details, Contact and, Address, you can embed all the three documents in a single one as shown below 
							{
								_id: ,
								Emp_ID: "10025AE336"
								Personal_details:{
									First_Name: "Radhika",
									Last_Name: "Sharma",
									Date_Of_Birth: "1995-09-26"
								},
								Contact: {
									e-mail: "radhika_sharma.123@gmail.com",
									phone: "9848022338"
								},
								Address: {
									city: "Hyderabad",
									Area: "Madapur",
									State: "Telangana"
								}
							}


		Normalized Data Model - 
				In this model, you can refer the sub documents in the original document, using references. For example, you can re-write the above document in the normalized model as:

							Personal_details:
									{
										_id: <ObjectId102>,
										empDocID: " ObjectId101",
										First_Name: "Radhika",
										Last_Name: "Sharma",
										Date_Of_Birth: "1995-09-26"
									}
							Contact:
									{
										_id: <ObjectId103>,
										empDocID: " ObjectId101",
										e-mail: "radhika_sharma.123@gmail.com",
										phone: "9848022338"
									}
							Address:
									{
										_id: <ObjectId104>,
										empDocID: " ObjectId101",
										city: "Hyderabad",
										Area: "Madapur",
										State: "Telangana"
									}
