****               Chapter 15 - Routing               *******
*************************************************************
Routing protocols lessen the day-to-day administrative burden of maintaining routing information.

It’s important to distinguish between the process of actually forwarding IP packets and the management of the routing table that drives this process, both of which are commonly called “routing.”

Route computation is tricky. This chapter describes only unicast routing.

Multicast routing (sending packets to groups of subscribers) involves an array of very different problems.

TCP/IP Networking, is all you need to know about routing.

If the appropriate network infrastructure is already in place, you can set up a single static route (as described in the Routing section starting on page 465) and voilà, you have enough information to reach just about anywhere on the Internet.
