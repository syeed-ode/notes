BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) - 
BGP is an exterior routing protocol; that is, a protocol that manages traffic among autonomous systems rather than among individual networks. 

There were once several exterior routing protocols in common use, but BGP has outlasted them all. 

BGP is now the standard protocol used for Internet backbone routing. 

As of mid 2010, the Internet routing table contains about 320,000 prefixes. It should be clear from this number that backbone routing has very different scaling requirements from local routing.
