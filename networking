****    Section 17.2 - How DNS Works    ****
Delegation
	Each domain can delegate authority for its subdomains to other servers.
	
	All name servers read the identities of the root servers from a local config file or have them built into the code.  
	
	The root servers know the name servers for com, net, edut, fi, de and other TLD.  Farther down the chain, edu knows about colorado.edu, berkeley.edu, and so.

****    Section 17.4 - Name Severs    ****
pg. 557
Name servers peform the following chores:
	* It answers questions about your sites hostnames and IP addresses
	* It asks about local and remote hosts for your users
	* It caches answers to these queries so it can answer faster next time
	* It transfers data between your nameservers to keep them synchronized
A zone is a group of resource records located at the same place in the dns name space (i.e. domain 
	or subdoman). The data for DNS domain usually usually includes two zones: 1) translating 
	hostnames to IP address, called forwarding zones, the other for translating IP addresses back 
	to hostnames call reverse zones.   
Authoritative (root servers and TLD servers, i.e., nonrecursive) (are official representatives of a 
	zone) and nonauthoritative (recursive servers, which caches data from previous queries) query 
	answers describe a name servers source of data (and the completeness of the data handed out).  
	An authoritative answer from a name server is “guaranteed’ to be accurate.  Nonauthoritative 
	data answers may come from a cache and may not know if the data is still valid.  Answers from 
	primary and secondary name servers are authoritative for their own zones, but not for information 
	they may have cached. 
Recursive server returns only real answers and error messages.  It follows referrals itself, relieving 
	clients of this responsibility.
For security reasons, an organization’s externally accessible name servers should always be 
	nonrecursive. **Any local name server listed in a client’s *resolv.conf* file must be 
	recursive.**
[DNS servers also implement negative caching.  That is, they remember when a query fails and do not 
	repeat that query until the negative caching TTL value has expired.  Negative caching saves 
	answers of the following types:
		* No host or domain matches the named queried.
		* The type of data requested does not exist for this host.
		* The server to ask is not responding.
		* The server to ask is unreachable because of network problems.
	BIND caches the first two types of negative data; Unbound caches all four.  Each implementation 
		allows the negative cache times to be configured.]

****    Section 17.5 - The DNS Namespace    ****
Name servers are associated with zones, not domains. If the artist.com domain were further subdivided 
	into the subdomains engineering, marking, and booklet, then the domain atrust.com would contain 
	four zones: the original atrust.com, plus engineering.atrust.com, marketing.atrust.com, and 
	booklab.atrust.com. The atrust.com zone contains all the hosts in atrust.com except those in 
	engineering, marketing and booklab. 
The difference between a subdomains and hosts is a 
	subdomains have a name server (NS) records associated with them. 
Parent domains should check to be sure that a child domain's name servers are up and running before 
	permforming the delegation.  If the servers are not working a lame delegation results.
There are two types of top-level domains (TLDs): country code domains (ccTLDs) and generic top level domains (gTLDs). 
Registering a second-level domain name
	To obtain a second-level domain, you must apply to a registrar for the appropriate TLD. You must 1) choose a name that has not been taken, 2) have (technical/admin) contact people, and 3) have two hosts that will be names servers.
	
	Creating a subdomain is similar creating a second-level domain, except the central authority is now local (within your organization). The steps are 1) choose a unique name in the local context, 2) have two name servers, 3) coordinate with the administrator for the parent domain.
	
	Parent domains sould check to be sure that a child domain's name servers are up and running before performing the delegation. Delegation is where the child reads the authority of the root servers.

****    Section 17.6 - Designing Your DNS Environment    ****
	* Managing the namespace hierarchy: subdomains, multiple levels, etc.
	* Serving the authoritative data about your site to the outside world
	* Providing name lookups for your users

Namespace management - Managing the namespace hierarchy: subdomains, multiple levels, etc.
	Make sure your firewall doesn't block subdomains if they require the outside world to access them

Authoritative servers - Serving the authoritative data about your site to the outside world
	The DNS specification require at least two authoritative servers for eadh domain. Primary (an 
		official representative of a zone) and secondary (copies data from primary) servers 
		are authoritative. 
	Caching and stub servers are not authortative. Caching servers caches data from previous queries; 
		usually have no local zones. Stub servers are like a secondary but copies only name 
		server data (not host data).
	Authoritative servers keep their data synchronized by using zone transfers. You can usese TSIG 
		(transaction signatures) keys to authenticate and control the zone transfers from your 
		primary server to your secondary servers.
	"Split-DNS" may be preferred. This is when an authoritative query response is different depending 
		upon who is asking.  Queries from inside the network get more information than the queires 
		outside the network. This is called a view.  The Bind configuration file configures the 
		view. External folks see one view, internal folks see another.

Caching servers - Providing name lookups for your users
	Recursive caching servers answer local users questions about sites on the internet.  Each computer 
		at your site should have ready access to a local caching server (configured in 
		/etc/resolv.conf).
	If the caching server dies, the network essentiall stops working for all the users that were primary 
		clients of that server.  This is why it's good to have more than one name server listed in 
		/etc/resolv.conf.

Hardware requirements - Providing name lookups for your users
	CPU is probably the least critical but it will become more critical as DNSSEC is fully 
		deployed.
	Recursive servers need enough memeory to cache all the answers your users demand.  It takes a week 
		or two to converge on a stable size at which old cache records are expiring at the rate at 
		about the same rate that new ones are being inserted.
	Authoritative servers need enough memory to store all the data for which they are authoritatve.  Most 
		sites can handle this but servers for TLD and DNS hosting sites may need either huge memories 
		or special software that facilitates storing part of the data on disk. 

DomainKeys Identify Mail (DKIM)
	Each originating email server signs the email with a private key.

Author Domain Signing Practice (ADSP)
	Allows a site to say whether it signs all, part or none of the outgoing email for each DNS zone.
	
Sender Policy Framework 

DNSSEC
	This standard adds authentication data to the DNS database and its servers. It uses public key 
		cryptography to verify the source and integrety of DNS data and uses DNS to distribute data 
		as well as host data.

****    Section 17.8 - The DNS Database    ****
The zone's DNS database is a set of text files maintained on the zone's primary servers. They are 
	sometimes refered to as zone files. They contain two types of entries: parser commands and 
	resource records.
A zone is a group of resource records located at the same place in the dns name space. The data for DNS 
	domain usually usually includes two zones: 1) translating hostnames to IP address, called 
	forwarding zones, the other for translating IP addresses back to hostnames call reverse zones.   

Commands in the zone files
	Commands either influence the way the parser interprets seqbsequent records or they expand into 
		records themselves. 
	Three commands are standard in DNS and the fourth, $GENERATE, is only found in BIND. They are:
		$ORIGIN <domain name>
		$INCLUE <filename> <origin>
		$TTL <default-ttl>
	Ths origin defaults to the domain name specired in the name servers configuration file. 
		However you can set or change it using the $ORIGIN directive. Using the relative names 
		instad of the FQDN saves a lot of time.
	Many sites use $INCLUDE to keey the cryptographic keys in a file with restricted permission.  
		This is also use to modulize the domain. If you use the <origin> option, it overwrites 
		the current $ORIGIN directive. So you need to reset it, either at the bottom of the 
		<filename> or after the $INCLUDE statement.
	The $TTL directive sets the ttl for the records that follow it. (So, it should be at the top.) 
		It defaults to 1 day. 

Resource records
	Resource records are text files for **each host** on your domain. The file includes the host 
		name, the type of record, and some data values. The name field can be ommited if the 
		value for name is the same as the line above it.
	Resource records are the lingua franca of DNS and are independent of configuration files that 
		control DNS operations.  This is the information the nonauthoritative caching servers 
		cache about a domain or host.
	Each site maintians one or more pieces of the distrubuted database that make up the DNS system. 
		Your piece of the database consist of text files that contains records for each of your 
		hosts. These are known as "resource records". 
	Each zone has a set of resource records associated with it.  
		[<name>] [<ttl>] [<class>] <type> data
	<name> 	identifies the entity that the entry describes (usually a host or domain). A name can be 
		relative or absolute. Absolute name have a "." at the end of them.
	<ttl> 	speciries the time to live for the reords that follow. The default is 1 day. Modifying the 
		ttl can aid in the maintenance process if necessary.
	<class> IN, for internet; CH, for ChaosNet (obsolete) used internally for name servers to 
		identify themselves; HS, for Hesiod, a directory serveice used locally by some sites.
			Administrators and hackers use the name sever version number to identify 
				servers in need of an upgrade. 
	<type> 	This determines the contents of the data field.  There are four groups of resource 
		records:

	Zone records:		identify domains and name servers
		SOA	Start of authority	
		NS	Identifies ervers, delegates subdomains
	Baseic records:		map between name and addresses and map mail
		A	Name to IP address translation (IPv4)
		AAAA	Name to IP address translation (IPv6)
		MX	Mail exchange, controles email routing
		PTR	Pointer record, address to name server translation
	Security records:	add authenticatoin and signatures to zone files. Security resource records 
				require cryptographic processing and so much be managed with software tools.
		DS	Delegation signer, a hash of child zone's key signing key
		DNSKEY	Public key for a DNS name
		NSEC
		NSEC3	Next secure (version 3), used with DNSSEC for negative answer 
		RRSIG	Signature; signed, authenticated resource record set
		DLV	Lookaside, non root trust anchor for DNS
		SSHFP	SSH Fingerprint, SSH host key allows verification of DNS
		SPF	Sender policy framework, identifies mail server inhibits forgery
		DKIM	DomainKey Identificaton Mail, verify email sender and message integrity
	Optional records:	proivde information about host or domains
		CNAME	Canonical name, alias or nickname for a site
		SRV	Services, gives location of well known services
		TXT	Text, commets or untyped information
	
	The order of a resource record is arbitrary. But, it's good practice to put SOA first, then NS 
		next. Then sort by name.
	The secondary servers' zone file (resource records) are not managed manually, but 
		programatically.  Who knows what order you'll get when you look at them.

SOA record (Start of Authority) - 
	The <zone name> field or <name> field sometimes contains the @ smpbol. That name of the @ 
		symbol is the <zonw> field of the 'name.conf' and is the domain name. It also can be 
		the <name> filed of the 'nsd.conf' file.
	Each zone has exactly one start of authority (SOA) record. The record includes:
		<zone name> 	name of the zone
		<primary NS> 	the primary name server for the zone
		<ttl> 		ttl for NS
		<email address>	technical contact, note this is really dns-admin@google.com. Just 
				remove the first ",", replacing it with the @ symbol and remove the 
				FQDN "." to send an email to the domain admin.
		<serial number> The serial number of the zones configuration data.  The secondary 
				servers use this number to determine when to get fresh data.
		various timeout values
			<rf>	refresh timeout value, used for the secondary servers to know when to 
				get an update. When it expires, the secondary checks the serial number 
				of the primary. If the primary's serial number is larger, the secondary 
				requests a zone transfer to update the data.
			<rt> 	retry value, specified how long a secondary should wait before checking 
				the serial number of the primary
			<exp> 	expiration value, determines how long the secondary will serve as 
				primary if the primary doesn't respond. It should be a week to a month 
				(incase the primary is down for an exhorbantly long time).
			<min> 	minimum value, is used for negative caching. This is how long a 
				secondary will ignore a server that returned a failed query. BIND 
				ignores values larger than 3 hours.
			<updt>

NS (name server) records:
	The name server records identify the servers that are authoriative (both primary and secondary) 
		for a zone. These servers also delagated to external organizations the subdomains 
		within its zones.
	The name server record includes:
		] $ dig NS
		;; QUESTION SECTION:
				IN	NS

		;; ANSWER SECTION:
.			415149	IN	NS	b.root-servers.net.
.			415149	IN	NS	j.root-servers.net.
.			415149	IN	NS	k.root-servers.net.
.			415149	IN	NS	g.root-servers.net.
.			415149	IN	NS	m.root-servers.net.
.		any	415149	IN	NS	ns1.any.root-servers.net.
.			415149	IN	NS	ubuntu.root-servers.net.
	The first 5 lines represent the name server for the a.root-servers.net. domain, specified in 
		the SOA (start of authority) record. The name sever (just an example) is 
		any.[fenl].root-servers.net.. Note the "." makes the domain name absolute. The class 
		(IN) didn't have to be listed either.  IN is the default.
	The 5th line delegates a subdomain to ns1.any and ubuntu.  The subdomain is called 
		any.root-server.net.  Both, ns1.any and ubuntu are name servers.  These records are 
		really part of the any.root-server.net subdomain, but they must appear in the parent 
		zone, root-servers.net. in order for the delegation to work.  In a similar fashion 
		root-server.net. must appear in .net.'s zone file to define the root-server.net's 
		subdomain and identify its servers.
	A list of the name servers in the parent's zone file should be kept up to date with those in 
		the subdomain's zone's file. If none of the name servers in the parents exist in the 
		child, the so-called lame delegation results. Extra servers in the child is ok, as long 
		as there is at least one child server listed by the parent.

A records:
	A (address) records are the heart and soul of the DNS database. They map hostnames to IP 
		addresses, being named forwarding zones. This was previously provided by /etc/hosts.

PTR records:
	The PTR (pointer) record maps from IP address back to hostname (the reverse zone). The 189 
		subnet, for example, has a zone name of 189.173.63.in-addr.arpa. The pointer record 
		for 189.173.63.in-addr.arpa is:
				1		IN 		PTR 	any.root-server.com
	Since the name 1 does not end in a dot, it is a relative.  But relative to what? Not 
		any.root-server.com -- for this to be accurate, the default zone has to be 
		183.173.63.in-addr.arpa. .
	Another way to do reverse matching is to put the records such as 
		[ 1 89		IN  PTR. any.root-server.com. ] in the zone 
		173.63.in-addr.arpa.. Since root-server.com and 173.63.in-addr.arpa. are two different 
		regions of the DNS namespace, they each have their own start of authority (SOA) and 
		resource records. They represent two different zones.
	It is important that A records match their corresponding PTR records. Mismatched PTR records 
		can cause authentication errors that bring you network to a crawl.

MX records:
	The mail system uses mail exchanger [MX] record to route mail more efficiently.  This system 
		puts the flow of mail under the control of the system admin instead of senders. It's 
		format is
			<name>	[ttl]	[IN]	MX	<preference> <host>

	The records below route mail addressed to user@somehost.atrust.com to the machine 
		mailhost.atrust.com. If that machine is not available, the mail goes to 
		mail-relay.atrust.com. If both machines faile, the mail is routed to the requested 
		host: somehost.atrust.com.
			somehost	IN 	MX 	10 mailhost.atrust.com.
					IN 	MX 	20 mail-relay.atrust.com.
	Every host the outside world knows about should have an MX record. Host that can never or 
		should never receive email (e.g. network printers) should also have a MX record. Avoid 
		wildcard MX records. It sends every other domain to that MX subnet.

CNAME records:
