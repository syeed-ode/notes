Installing Snort and Getting Started

A Snort installation may consist of only a working Snort daemon or of a complete Snort system with many other tools. 
	If you install only Snort, you can capture intrusion data in text or binary files and then view these files later on with the help of a text editor or some other tool like Barnyard. 

	With this simple installation you can also send alert data to an SNMP manager, like HP OpenView or OpenNMS, in the form of SNMP traps.

	Sending Server Message Block (SMB) messages to Microsoft Windows-based machines. Alert data can also be sent to a Microsoft Windows machine in the form of SMB pop-up windows.

	You can log  Snort data to a database and analyzing it through a web interface. 

	Using the web interface, you can view all alerts generated by Snort. The analysis tools allow you to make sense of the captured data instead of spending lots of time with Snort log files.

	A comprehensive working Snort system utilizes these tools to provide a web-based user interface with a backend database.

MySQL is used with Snort to log alert data. Apache acts as a web server. PHP is used as an interface between the web server and MySQL database. ACID is a PHP package that is used to view and analyze Snort data using a web browser. GD library is used by ACID to create graphs. PHPLOT is used to present data in graphic format on the web pages used in ACID. GD library must be working correctly to use PHPLOT. ADODB is used by ACID to connect to MySQL database.

2.1 Snort Installation Scenarios
	2.1.1 Test Installation
		A single Snort sensor logs data to text files which can be viewed later on by the Snort administrator. The cost of data analysis is very high in the production environment.

	2.1.2 Single Sensor Production IDS
		A production installation of Snort with only one sensor is suitable for small networks with only one Internet connection. This allwos you to detect the activity of intruders into the system. 

		The logging is done in text or binary files and tools like SnortSnarf can be used to analyze data. SnortSnarf is discussed in Chapter 6 in detail.

	2.1.3 Single Sensor with Network Management System Integration
		In a production system, you can configure Snort to send traps to a network management system. Snort integration into these network management systems is done through the use of SNMP traps.

	2.1.4 Single Sensor with Database and Web Interface
		The database is used to log Snort data where it can be viewed and analyzed later on, using a web-based interface. A typical setup consists of three basic components:
				1. Snort sensor
				2. A database server
				3. A web server

		You can view the data using a web browser connected to the sensor. PHP is used to get data from the database and to generate web pages.

		This setup provides a very good and comprehensive IDS which is easy to manage and user friendly. 

	2.1.5 Multiple Snort Sensors with Centralized Database
		There are multiple ways to setup and install Snort in the enterprise as a distributed IDS.

		One method is all data generated by these sensors is stored in the database. You run a web server like Apache.

		However there are some practical problems with this setup.
			• All of the sensors must have access to the database at the time you start Snort. If Snort is not able to connect to the database at the start time, it dies.
			• The database must be available all of the time to all sensors. If any of the network links are down, data is lost. 
			• You have to open up additional ports for database logging in firewalls if a firewall lies between the database server and any of the sensors. Sometime this is not feasible or against security policy.

		Another method is where Snort sensors may be configured to log to local files. These files can then be uploaded to a centralized server.
				Certain utilities like Snort itself, Barnyard or some other tool to extract data from these log files and put it into the database server.

				The only problem with this approach is that the data in the database is not strictly “real-time”.

	The ultimate objective of this book is to help you install Snort and to make all of these packages work with each other.
