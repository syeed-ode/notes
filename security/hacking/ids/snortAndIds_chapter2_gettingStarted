Installing Snort and Getting Started

A Snort installation may consist of only a working Snort daemon or of a complete Snort system with many other tools. 
	If you install only Snort, you can capture intrusion data in text or binary files and then view these files later on with the help of a text editor or some other tool like Barnyard. 

	With this simple installation you can also send alert data to an SNMP manager, like HP OpenView or OpenNMS, in the form of SNMP traps.

	Sending Server Message Block (SMB) messages to Microsoft Windows-based machines. Alert data can also be sent to a Microsoft Windows machine in the form of SMB pop-up windows.

	You can log  Snort data to a database and analyzing it through a web interface. 

	Using the web interface, you can view all alerts generated by Snort. The analysis tools allow you to make sense of the captured data instead of spending lots of time with Snort log files.

	A comprehensive working Snort system utilizes these tools to provide a web-based user interface with a backend database.
