# notes

This is a collection of notes from different reading material (books, websites, white papers, etc.). It mainly broken down by reference. However some information, such as database/spring/springTransactions includes prequisite information.

All in all, you should be able to pick up a topic, be a complete novice, and achieve an understanding of the subject matter. 

If the document has a code refernce, it is likely there is a repository with the full working example. python and oauth/oauth2InAction_chapter02_* are a good example of this.
