23.5 Caching and Proxy Servers
	Web caching is the temporary storage of web objects (such as HTML documents) for later retrieval. There are three significant advantages to web caching: 
			reduced bandwidth consumption 
				(fewer requests and responses that need to go over the network), 

			reduced server load 
				(fewer requests for a server to handle), and 

			reduced latency 
				(since responses for cached requests are available immediately, and closer to the client being served).

	Together, they make the web less expensive and better performing.

	It doesn't make sense to transmit a popular web page from Autralia to North America millions of times each day. There should be a way to store this informaiton.

	Fortunately, there is -- at least at the site leve. A web proxy lets you cache and manage your site's outbound requests for web content.

	Client web browser contact the proxy server to request content. The proxy server makes a request on the client's behalf or provides the object from its cache.

	Proxy severs are often used to enhance security or filter content.

	In a proxy-based system, only one machine gets access to the internet going through a firewall. Many commercial proxies are available today. See http://www.web-caching.com/proxy-caches.html.
