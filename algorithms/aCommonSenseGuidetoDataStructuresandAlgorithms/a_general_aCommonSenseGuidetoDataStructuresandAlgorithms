Array:
	Reading: 		O(1) - you only need the first value and added what 
						   you're looking for
	Searching: 		O(N) - you have to read every item in the array
	Insertion: 		O(N) - inserting at index 0 requires shifting every 
						   item to the right


Linked List:
	Reading: 		O(N) - you have to read every item in the list
	Searching: 		O(N) - you have to read every item in the list 
	Insertion: 		O(N) - even though all you have to do is update pointer 
						   values, you have to read the list until the end 
						   O(N), then update the pointers O(1).
