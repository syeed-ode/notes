With the increasing prevalence of data in our daily lives, new and better tools are needto analyze the deluge.

Traditionally there ahve been two ends of the spectrum: lightweight, individual analysis using tools like Excel or SPSS, and heavy duty, high-performance analysius built with C++ and the like.

Analysis done by an individual on his or her computer is the domain of R, Python and other scripted languages.

R is a high-level language that was originally intented to be run interactively, where the user runs a command, gets a result, and then runs another command. 

It has since evolved int a language that can tackle complex problems.

In addition to transforming and analyziang data, R can produce amazing graphics and reports with ease.

It is now being used as a full stack for data analsysis, extracting and transforming data, fitting models, drawing inferences and making predictions, plotting and reporting results.
