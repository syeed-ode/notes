****  Getting Started in R~Stata Notes on Exploring Data ****
*************************************************************
What is R?
	• “R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics”*
	• R is offered as open source (i.e. free)

What is Stata?
	• It is a multi-purpose statistical package to help you explore, summarize and analyze datasets.
	• A dataset is a collection of several pieces of information called variables (usually arranged by columns). A variable can have one or several values (information for one or several cases).
	• Other statistical packages are SPSS and SAS.

Highlevel comments about R
	Personally, I prefer R. Learning two frameworks would be too much trouble, and SPSS only would not suffice for me.

	The main drawback of R is the learning curve: you need a few weeks just to be able to import data and create a simple plot.

	To make it worse you will not cease learning basic operations (e.g. for plotting) for many years.
			You will stumble upon weirdest problems all the time because you have missed the comma. 

			Maybe you'll encoutner a problem because your data frame collapses to a vector if only one row is selected.

	However, once you mastered this, you will have the full arsenal of modern cutting-edge statistical techniques at your disposal. 
			This includes along with in-depth manuals, references, specialized packages, graphical interface, a helpful community 

			This all comes at no cost.

			Also, you will be able to do stunning graphics.

	That said, learning statistics is way more important than learning R or SPSS or whatever else.
			An easy to use graphical interface is deceitful, if you do not understand what it really does.

			I have seen people doing complex analyses without really understanding basic concepts of statistics.

			They thought that they got the correct results, but in fact were doing terrible things.

	R is helpful in the sense that it is hard to do something if you don't understand what you want (or need) to do. 

Difference between R and STATA
	How often do you deal with data?
		If you work with data once in a blue moon, it is best to stick with a program your colleagues know and can trouble shoot and has a good GUI and documentation. 

		SPSS is common in medical and social sciences, while STATA is the norm in econometrics. 

		STATA  has both a command line and a GUI, and its documentation is the best in the industry. If you are tech savvy I suggest STATA is a good choice.

	Is reproducible research important to you?
		R has the best environment for reproducible research. 

		Since what is done on a GUI is hard to document and therefore hard to reproduce, every scientist should aspire to produce reproducible research. 
				Unfortunately R is the hardest to learn initially although it is not harder than SAS. 

				Best of all it is free and has a great community. 

				You can easily share your code with someone in stackoverflow and get your answers

		This means you are not limited by the local expertise available.
