Amazon IAM (Identity and Access Management) enables you to manage users and user permissions in AWS.

You can create one or more IAM users in your AWS account. 
		You might create an IAM user for someone who needs access to your AWS console, or 

		when you have a new application that needs to make API calls to AWS. 

		This is to add an extra layer of security to your AWS account.

In this chapter, we are going to create a new IAM user for a couple of the AWS related tools we are going to be using later.

Create User
		Select IAM from the list of services.

		Select Users.
				Select Add User.
						Enter a User name (serverlessAppAdminUser) and check Programmatic access, then select Next: Permissions.
								Programmatic access enables an access key ID and secret access key for the AWS API, CLI, SDK, and other development tools.

						This account will be used by our AWS CLI and Serverless Framework.
								They’ll be connecting to the AWS API directly and will not be using the Management Console.

				Select Attach existing policies directly.
						Search for AdministratorAccess and select the policy, then select Next: Review.

						We can provide a more fine-grained policy here and we cover this later in the Customize the Serverless IAM Policy chapter. 

						But for now, let’s continue with this.

						Select Create user.
									User name: 				serverlessAppAdminUser
									AWS access type: 		Programmatic access - with an access key
									Permissions boundary: 	Permissions boundary is not set

						Select Show to reveal Secret access key
