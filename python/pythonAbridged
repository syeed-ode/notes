'setDefault'
	The single call to 'setdefault' has replace the two-line 'if/not in' statement and its usage guarantess that a key is always initialized to a starter value before it's used.

	Any possibity of a 'KeyError' exception is negated. The below code shows what would generate a 'KeyError' exception.


Item 22: Prefer Helper Classes Over Bookkeeping with Dictionaries and Tuples
		Avoid more than one level of nesting (i.e. avoid dictionaries of dictionaries). It makes your code hard to read and sets you up for a maintenace nightmare. 

		Avoid making dictionaries with values that are other dictionaries or long tuples.

		Use 'namedtuple' for lightweight, immutable data containers before you need the flexibility of a full class.

		Move your bookkeeping code to use multiple helper classes when your internal state dictionaries get complicated.
